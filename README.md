## Introduction
Employee attrition, or turnover, can have significant financial and operational impacts on a company. In this project, we analyze the attrition rate of employees across different factors such as monthly income, years since last promotion, age, job satisfaction, and job roles. The goal is to identify key drivers behind employee attrition and to provide recommendations that can help reduce turnover.

## Key Findings

### Attrition Rate by Factors
- **Monthly Income**: Employees who quit tend to have lower monthly incomes compared to those who stay. Financial compensation is a significant factor influencing employee retention.
  
- **Years Since Last Promotion**: Employees who have been promoted recently are more likely to quit, suggesting that promotions may not meet their expectations or that they are seeking further career advancement.

- **Age**: Younger employees are more likely to quit, which may be due to career exploration or dissatisfaction with their current roles.

- **Job Satisfaction**: Low job satisfaction correlates with higher attrition rates, indicating the importance of addressing employee fulfillment.

- **Performance Rating**: Performance ratings show minimal difference between those who quit and those who stay, suggesting that performance alone does not predict attrition.

- **Education Level**: There is no significant difference in attrition rates based on education level.

### Attrition Rate by Job Role
- **High Attrition Roles**: 
  - Sales Representatives (28%)
  - Laboratory Technicians (17%)
  - Human Resources (16%)
  
- **Low Attrition Roles**:
  - Research Directors, Managers, and Healthcare Representatives have the lowest attrition rates, around 4-5%.

## Recommendations
To reduce employee attrition, the following strategies are recommended:

1. **Enhance Compensation Packages**: Review and adjust compensation for high-turnover roles, such as Sales Representatives and Laboratory Technicians, to make these positions more competitive.
  
2. **Career Development Programs**: Implement or enhance career development and progression opportunities, particularly for employees who have recently been promoted.

3. **Improve Job Satisfaction**: Regular surveys and feedback mechanisms can help identify and address the factors affecting job satisfaction, especially in departments with high turnover.

4. **Targeted Retention Strategies**: Focus on retention strategies for younger employees and roles with high attrition, such as Sales Representatives and Human Resources.
